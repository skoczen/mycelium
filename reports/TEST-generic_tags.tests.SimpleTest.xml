<![CDATA[ ! Error found during real run of migration! Aborting.

 ! Since you have a database that does not support running
 ! schema-altering statements in transactions, we have had 
 ! to leave it in an interim state between migrations.

! You *might* be able to recover with:   = DROP TABLE `cms_cmsplugin` CASCADE; []
   = DROP TABLE `cms_title` CASCADE; []
   = DROP TABLE `cms_pagepermission` CASCADE; []
   = DROP TABLE `cms_page` CASCADE; []
   = DROP TABLE `cms_placeholder` CASCADE; []
   = DROP TABLE `cms_page_sites` CASCADE; []

 ! The South developers regret this has happened, and would
 ! like to gently persuade you to consider a slightly
 ! easier-to-deal-with DBMS.
 ! NOTE: The error which caused the migration to fail is further up.
 ! Error found during real run of migration! Aborting.
