				<p>Many small nonprofits have their information scattered across a number of systems: there's the contacts program, the volunteer log, the donors program, and the various lists of participants, major donors, and the people who are coming to Thursday's event.  </p>

				<p>Wouldn't it be nice if there was one place for all that information? Well, now there is.</p>



				<p>With GoodCloud, all of your nonprofit's core information has one home, accessible from anywhere. Even better, the information is actually <i>connected</i>. If you've ever wondered how many of your volunteers are also donors, you can now have that answer. </p>

				<p>If you've ever struggled with who has the latest version of a volunteer list, you can leave that headache behind. With GoodCloud, all of your lists are kept up to date in real-time.  We don't like headaches. We figure you don't either.</p>

		<p>Nonprofit staff are simply amazing at remembering people, faces, and interactions.  But wouldn't it be nice to not have to ask the development director about the last call before sending an email? </p>

		<p>With GoodCloud, it's easy to record the interactions you have with all the people your organizations touches. When the phone rings, you can be on the same page in a matter of seconds.</p>

Unless your mission involves computers, chances are you'd rather not be staring at one.  One of our core goals in designing GoodCloud was to make the processes nonprofits do dozens of times a day really fast. Things like looking up a phone number or email, or printing a mailing label.  We've made it as quick and simple as possible to common tasks, so you can get in, get the information you need, and get on with your day.
