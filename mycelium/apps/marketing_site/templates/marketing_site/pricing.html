					<div class="title">Why $50?</div>
			
					When we started GoodCloud, we interviewed small nonprofits to see what they were paying for their software needs.  Then we took the smallest number we heard, and cut it in half.  We believe that small nonprofits should have access to great software at a price they can afford.

			<p>Our pricing is based on a radical concept: <i>we want to help you grow</i>.  </p>

			<p>Other companies watch you bringing in a new staff member and see dollar signs.  We see you succeeding, and cheer. </p>

			<p>Other services see you reaching more donors and volunteers, and see dollar signs. We say, "Add some more!"  We've built a <a href="{% url marketing_site:about_us %}">sustainable business that we love</a> on those $50 a month - and we're happy with that.  What we really want is a better world, and you're the key to making that happen.  You have our full support.</p>

			<p>Here's some of the unlimited you get at GoodCloud:
			<ul>
				<li>Unlimited number of users</li>
				<li>Unlimited number of contacts</li>
				<li>Unlimited number of donations</li>
				<li>Unlimited donation history</li>
				<li>Unlimited volunteer history</li>
				<li>Unlimited number of tags</li>
				<li>Unlimited imports and exports</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
			Here's what else we won't do:
			<ul>
				<li>No charge for support</li>
				<li>No call center halfway across the world</li>
				<li>No sudden price changes</li>
				<li>No treating you like a dollar sign.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			You're real people, doing real good in the world. We promise to treat you that way.

			<div class="page_top_hook">See for yourself.</div>

			When you sign up for a GoodCloud account, your first 30 days are on us.  We'll be in touch throughout those 30 days to see if you have questions, and to learn a bit more about you and your organization.  You know, like real people do.
