		<div class="tab_subheading nonprofits_deserve">Small nonprofits deserve the best software in the world.</div>

		<p>There, we said it. Not hand-me-downs, not corporate products that don't fit, but a real solution designed around your needs and how you work. We started GoodCloud after watching first-hand some of our favorite nonprofits struggle with a hodge-podge of programs. We heard stories of daily frustrations, and listened to organizations that were pouring hours into fighting with computers instead of their missions. We said, "Enough with that!", and we started GoodCloud to fix it.</p>

		<div class="tab_subheading">We &hearts; small nonprofits.</div>
		<p>We care deeply about you and your mission. You've made the decision to make the world a better place instead of making piles of money. We admire you. Nonprofits are doing the biggest things to make the world a better place. We're thankful to have you in the world, and we want to help you thrive.</p>

		<div class="tab_subheading">We get small nonprofits.</div>
		<p>You're different. You're not a corporation. You're not a club. You're not a small business. We get that. Nobody else has to file Form 990's. Nobody else has to track volunteer hours. Nonprofits are unique, living organizations with different needs and ways of working.  We're building software just for you.</p>

		<div class="tab_subheading">We only serve small nonprofits.</div>
		<p>We're building you the best software in the world. But the cool part is, it's just for you.  You can't use GoodCloud unless you're a nonprofit.  Run a big company, and want our cool people-tracking software? Tough.  GoodCloud isn't the side project of a giant software maker, it's a small and nimble company that works exclusively with small nonprofits.  We like it that way, and we think you will too.</p>

		<div class="tab_subheading team_description">GoodCloud is currently a team of two people. We're the ones who answer your calls, add new features, and talk with you about your needs.  Sounds a lot better than a call center halfway across the world, doesn't it? </div>
