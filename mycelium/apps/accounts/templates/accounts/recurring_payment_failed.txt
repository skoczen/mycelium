Hey Guys,

We've got an account that just had a recurring payment fail. Probably an expired credit card, or something like that.  Stripe's gonna retry a few more times, but we should get in touch.  After the next attempts fail, their account will go to deactivated.

Organization: {{account}}
Website: {{account.subdomain}}.agoodcloud.com.

Good Luck!
