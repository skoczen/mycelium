Hi {{useraccount.full_name}},

Welcome to GoodCloud! 

We're excited to start helping your nonprofit save time and smile at the computer screen more often!  This email contains a reminder of the information you'll need to log in, some tips for getting started (and a way to get half a month free!), and the best way to contact us.  We'll follow up in a few days to see if there's anything we can do to help, and to begin to get to know you and your organization personally.


Login Information
----------------------------------
You can get to your {{account}} GoodCloud anytime - just go to:
https://{{account.subdomain}}.agoodcloud.com

Once there, you can log in with the username and password you set up just a moment ago.  As a reminder, your username is {{useraccount.denamespaced_username}}.


Getting Started in GoodCloud
----------------------------------
Once you login to GoodCloud, you'll see a set of challenges. Completing these challenges (they're pretty easy!) will get you familiar with most of GoodCloud's features.  It will also earn you half-off your first paid month with us.  How sweet is that?


How to Contact Us
----------------------------------
We're committed to helping you get the most out of GoodCloud. There are a few ways to reach us.

Online - within GoodCloud, there's a "feedback & support" link on the bottom right. Click that, type your message, and we get it right away!
Email - you can also email support@agoodcloud.com, and we'll get right back to you.
Phone - if a phone call is easiest, you can reach us at (503) 308-1460.  

We're proud to serve small nonprofits like yours, and we hope you enjoy using GoodCloud!

-Tom & Steven
