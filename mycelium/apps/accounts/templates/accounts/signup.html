	<p>Hey there.  You're here to sign up for GoodCloud, and we're really sorry. </p>

	<p>After three years of trying to make the world's best software for small nonprofits, we've come to the unfortunate conclusion that GoodCloud isn't sustainable as full-time company.</p>
	<p>We also believe that nonprofits need more than a side-project, so we've made the very hard decision to close our doors, and begin to shut down GoodCloud.</p>

	<p>As a result, we're no longer accepting new signups. Existing clients were notified of the changes a few months back, and can still access their accounts fully as they migrate to other systems.</p>

	<p>It's one of the hardest decisions either Tom or I have made, but after lots of considerations and one-more-tries, we're both sad but sure it's the right one.</p>

	<p>Thank you for your interest, your support, and the best of luck in all your ventures.</p>

	<p>- Steven, Tom, and GoodCloud</p>
